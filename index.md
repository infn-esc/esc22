Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The presentations used for the lectures are attached to the
[agenda](https://agenda.infn.it/event/28243/) and can be downloaded as
a [single archive file](https://agenda.infn.it/event/28243/attachments/package),
but wait until the end of the week.

An [online
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qrhT3JoDezhlZNYrwClh_3k-yB-q_Hfo0quaKPBTZkU/edit?usp=sharing)
is available to collect questions and comments that you want to share during the
lectures or typos and mistakes that you notice.
