Compile the example `hands-on/floatingpoints/float-rep.c

       gcc float-rep.c -o float-rep

Run the executable ./float-rep and enter a number, its single-precision floating-point representation (as stored in memory) will be shown to you, next to the number which it actually represent.

- Play with the program to get familiar with floating point representation
- Try to extract floating point representation (in binary) for the number 17.625 (use the program to verify your answer!)
- Try to extract the base 10 value for the following floating point number:

```0 10000010 00011100000000000000000```
