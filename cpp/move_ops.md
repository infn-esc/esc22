title: Move operations
layout: main
category: cpp
---

The goal of this exercise is to get some confidence with move
semantics, in particular to implement the move operations of a class:
the move constructor and the move assignment.

Open the test program [`string.cpp`]({{site.exercises_repo}}/hands-on/cpp/string.cpp) and complete the existing code to:

* Complete the set of the special member functions so that String is copyable and movable
  
* Add `operator[]` (const and non-const) to access a character at a given position

* Add a `c_str()` member function to access the underlying C-style string

* Use a smart pointer instead of a raw pointer. Note that `std::unique/shared_ptr` and corresponding
  `make_unique/shared` support arrays

The commands to build and run the code are:

```shell
[student@esc ~]$ cd esc/hands-on/cpp
[student@esc cpp]$ g++ -Wall -Wextra -o string string.cpp
[student@esc cpp]$ ./string
```
